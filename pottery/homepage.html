        </div>
        <div class = "container2">
            <p>Our main focus is the manufacturing and selling of pots all around the world. We are in charge of many operations that focus on handcrafted pots that are sold to a growing clientele. Because of this growing demand, we are in constant need of recruiting more craftsmen to keep up with it. We take pride in that our pots are all handcrafted and of the finest quality that we can offer. Because of this, we offer competitive pay and benefits, as our craftsmen are the backbone of our company.</p>

            <p> How We Operate</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "contianer4">
            <p> Because all of the pots we sell are handmade, we have to ensure that the quality always remains up to our company standards, and as a result, inspections of the finished product are always mandatory. Each craftsman is responsible for the quality they produce, and every quality control inspection is required for every finished product. Often times, when a craftsman is found to be struggling to meet certain standards, they are often referred to have an inspector instruct them and help fix where they have been making a mistake in their process. Here at Hulman Pottery, we believe in operating in a safe work environment full of encouragement and professionalism that you will be required to follow if you choose to work with us. </p>
