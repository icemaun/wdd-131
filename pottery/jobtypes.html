            <p>Because we are a growing company, it is natural that we recruit people who focus on other essential services in our company. These often include the sales team and the school team. The sales team's main focus is on advertising and keeping in touch with customers both at home and abroad. The school team's main focus is to teach classes, take orders from customers on other assignments, and pass them on to the head manager of the craftsmen, who then assigns a craftsman to complete those orders. </p>

        <div class="contianer4">
            <p>The school team's main focus is to teach classes to both children and adults on how to make pottery by hand. These classes are designed to teach both hobbyists and enthusiasts how to create works of art and how to keep craftsmenship alive in pottery making. They are also in charge of quality control, and they make sure the products made by the craftsmen are up to the standards of Hulma pottery. </p>
